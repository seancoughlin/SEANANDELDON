						<H2> Our first update since the start! </H2>
					<br>
					<br>
					 <div class="center"; style="color: black">
					We finally made it to LA after a handful of roadblocks. Took us a total of 9 days and 639 miles. Better late than never!

						<p style="padding-bottom: 100px;">
							<h2> Day 9: Ojai > LA (93 miles)</h2>
							<br>
							<div class="scroll-container">
								<img src="17.jpg" alt="Hur-ali riding" width="600" height="400">
								<img src="18.jpg" alt="Packing" width="600" height="400">
							</div>
							<br>
							The longest day so far started with a visit to Einswine and Oinkenheimer, two of the cutest pigs ever. We also got some sound advice from Seth, a bikepacker who had done the east to west coast years ago: Travel light! Lots of material to send home when we hit LA.

							<br>
							<br> 
							All downhill to Ventura! Through Oxnard and back onto the PCH. A kind biker guided us to a sweet place to stop for a break along the 1: Bella's. Mean burrito. Thanks Ryan! 

							<br>
							<br> 
							Santa Monica was a circus. Rode through canals to Collin's house. Played with the family pups and shot pool with the Last Black Man in San Francisco.

							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>Day 8: Paradise Campground > Ojai (66 miles)</h2> 
							<br>
							<div class="scroll-container">
								<img src="19.JPG" alt="Hur-ali riding" width="600" height="400">

							<br>
							Happy birthday, Eldon! Birthday cake was a candle jammed into an orange. Stinky and running out of clean clothes. No laundry since leaving. Our friends in Ojai cleaned us up! Thanks to the Swifts for the pit stop and pig pen. 24 is off to a fresh start.

							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>Day 7: Pismo Beach > Paradise Campground (84 miles)</h2>
							<img src="12.JPG" width="300" class="center">
							<br>
							<br>
							Farm roads are the best. Mostly flat which makes for easier conversation. Eldon is convinced that he can made an e-bike out of a 9 volt DeWalt drill battery. He probably could.
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2>Day 6: Lake Nacimiento > Pismo Beach (70 miles)</h2>
							<br>
							<img src="21.JPG" width="300" class="center">
							<br>
							<br>
							We made it back onto the coastal highway since being turned around at Big Sur. Our legs had adjusted to the long days of pedaling, and our butts only hurt a little bit. We set up camp at the Pismo Beach campground. Park rangers interrogated us the next morning asking if we had made a reservation. We told them the truth. They gave us a generous 15 minutes to pack up and leave.
							<br>
							<br>
							People are so nice. We stopped at a Trader Joe's and one of the employees offered to host us at their place after hearing about our trip. If only it had been a little bit closer to Pismo. A true homie.

							<h2>Day 5: Arroyo Seco > Lake Nacimiento (75 miles)</h2>
							<br>
							<img src="11.jpg" width="300" class="center">
							<br>
							<br>
							Strange stretch of ride. We stopped in Greenfield for burritos at El Rinconcito. Very yummy. Continuing on the G14 was hilly as heck and a bit concerning. The sides of the roads were littered with broken glass, beer cans, and dead animals. We also found a rusted out grenade. Luckily, we remained unscathed by automobile and explosive. 
							<br>
							<br>
							Today's highlight was the Bee Rock, a Barbeque spot on Interlake Road. We stopped in for a bite but their ktichen was closed. Dana, the barkeep, opened it up for us anyways. She made us two bowls of the best chili either of us had ever eaten. The other barkeep (can't remember his name...) fed us free beer on one condition: we clean our dishes. Done deal, dishes clean, and bellies full, we finished our ride into Lake Nacimiento. It kinda looks like a dragon. 

							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>Day 4: Big Sur > Arroyo Seco (70 miles)</h2>
							<br>
							<img src="22.JPG" width="300" class="center">
							<br>
							<br>
							Back on track! We rode back up to Carmel and took the G16 into Carmel Village. We met another biker who showed us his favorite deli and grocery shop. Eldon and I got sandwiches and apples. It was another day of biking that continued into darkness. We arrived at what we thought was an open camp site but learned that it was closed because of rock slides. Luckily we met Katrina, a local backpacker and friendly person, who let us know of a good place to do secret camping. The stars that night were the brightest we had seen since the start of the trip. 

							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>Day 3: Monterey > Big Sur (40 miles)</h2>
							<br>
							<img src="10.jpg" width="300" class="center">
							<br>
							<br>
							This was the lovely setback of a day. After climbing and "wee!"-ing down the hills of highway 1, we stopped in at the Henry S. Miller library to ask about the condition of the road up ahead. Nico and Katie, the wonderful librarians, delivered unfortunate news: the road was closed and not even locals were walking across the reconstruction progress. 

							<br>
							<br>
							We met another biker who had folded up a Brompton and flewn in from India just to ride the 1. He had to call his trip short and phone a friend to pick him up. We all stayed at Pfeiffer State park that night. What a sweet place to be stuck. 

							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>Day 2: Santa Cruz > Monterey (60 miles)</h2>
							<br>
							<div class="scroll-container">
								<img src="9.JPG" alt="Hur-ali riding" width="600" height="400">
								<img src="14.JPG" alt="Packing" width="600" height="400">
							</div>
							<br>
							<br>
							After getting our butts kicked by a late start and dark highway riding, a shorter ride was a pleasant morale boost. We stopped at Trader Joes and Eldon got a green smoothie and some Chomps. It was one of my favorite breakfasts so far. Later on, Google maps routed us to bike on super tucked away equestrian trail that was gated off at the exit. We had to hoist our steeds over the closed gate to escape the trail. Ended the day with clam chowder and udon noodles. Mm.

							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>Day 1 (again): Daily City > Santa Cruz-ish (81 miles)
							<br></h2>
							<img src="7.jpg" width="300" class="center">
							<br>
							<br>
							After saying bye bye to friends and family at the Fruitvale Bike shop, we hopped on bart to Daily City. We underestimated how long it would take us to bike from there to Santa Cruz and ended up biking in the dark on the 1. Oopsie. Hana and Katie picked us up so that we could eat dinner before it got too cold. Kinda kicked our butts. 


							<h2>Day 1</h2>

								Eldon's family hosted a wonderful farewell party today. Friends and family that had never before met all came together to send us off and wish us well. Very fortunate and grateful for the love we share. 
								<br>
								<br>
								Photo 1 is Hana next to all of the things I'll be bringing. Toolbag, sleeping stuff, clothes, food, and fun activity objects. She came up on Uncle P's old jacket. Lucky duck.  
								<br>
								<br>
								Photo 2 is Eldon's unpacked bike. It's got a dynamo wheelset, some cool lights, and fun charms. His bags are all packed, but he realized he forgot his train hat and had to run back home and grab it. 
								<br>
								<br>
								Photo 3 is my unpacked bike. One big giant thank you to Coco for helping me build a frame bag and the cutest bottle holder ever. It's all secured with parachord and ready to be filled with fun items. If you ever need a cool item sewn... if you ask her nicely maybe she'll help you out. 
								<br>
								<br>
								Photo 4 is Hur-ali riding my bike down our street. He looks so cute on the bike and it fits him well. Very cool to see how other people fit it!
								<br>
								<br>
								And another huge thanks to all of the people at Alameda Bikes and most especially the Fruitvale Bart Bike Station. None of this trip would be at all possible without their knowledge and support. A truly wonderful network of bicycles enthusiasts and sincerely kind and generous people!
								<br>
								<br>
								I guess this is all stuff from Day T-01, but I'm writing this at 2:45am. We leave in about 7 hours to meet friends and family again for one final bye bye at the Fruitvale Bart station. To Santa Cruz!
								<br>

								<img src="2.jpg" width="300" class="center">
							</div>
							<br>
							<p style="padding-bottom: 100px;">
								I thought about starting an Instagram to document our travels, but I feel like requiring access to a computer will take us to some fun places. Having a phone at hand to post anything at any time kinda takes away the magic of a checkpoint. This way, we need to go to a library in order to update everyone and we'll probably have lots more fun stuff to say. 
								<br>
								And we can return any overdue books... eep!
								<br>
								<br>
								The bikes are slowly coming together! Victor and Eduardo helped me build up a Surly Bridge Club! Eldon is gonna be riding a Soma Grand Randonneur, I'll bug him for photos soon.
